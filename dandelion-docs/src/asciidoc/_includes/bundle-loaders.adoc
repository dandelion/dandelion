== 8. Bundle loaders

=== 8.1. Introducing bundle loaders

The main goals of bundle loaders are:

* to scan for bundle definitions in the classpath (JSON format in first, then XML format)
* to map each of the loaded files into a comprehensive format and feeds the <<#4-2-building-a-bundle-graph, bundle graph>>

=== 8.1. Built-in loaders

Dandelion comes with two built-in bundle loaders: `DandelionBundleLoader` and `VendorBundleLoader`. They basically do the same job except the location where to scan for bundle definitions.

Note that they're all mutually exclusive, which means that a folder or subfolder will never be scanned twice.

==== 8.1.1. `VendorBundleLoader`

This loader is intended to load vendor's librairies, such as http://jquery.com/[jQuery] or http://getbootstrap.com/[Bootstrap]. The only difference with the other built-in loader is that it scans for bundles inside the `dandelion/vendor` folder and all subfolders in the classpath.

Assuming the following https://maven.apache.org/[Maven] structure, the `VendorBundleLoader` will only pick up and load `jquery.json` and `bootstrap2.json` files.

.Example with a Maven project
[source, xml]
----
project-root
|__ src
   |__ main
      |__ resources
         |__ dandelion
            |__ vendor
               |__ jquery.json
               |__ bootstap2.json
            |__ foo.json <1>
            |__ bar.json <1>
----
<1> Both `foo.json` and `bar.json` bundles won't be picked up by the `VendorBundleLoader` because they are outside of the `dandelion/vendor` folder

All bundles loaded by this loader will be considered as *vendor bundles* in the rest of the documentation.

==== 8.1.2. `DandelionBundleLoader`

Its role is to scan the classpath recursively for bundles, starting from the `dandelion` folder.

Assuming the following https://maven.apache.org/[Maven] structure, the standard bundle loader will pick up and load `bundle1.json`, `bundle2.json` and `bundle3.json` files.

.Example with a Maven project
[source, xml]
----
project-root
|__ src
   |__ main
      |__ resources
         |__ dandelion
            |__ vendor
               |__ jquery.json <1>
            |__ bundle1.json
            |__ bundle2.json
            |__ bundle3.json 
----
<1> The `jquery.json` bundle won't be picked up by the `DandelionBundleLoader` because all bundle loaders are mutually exclusive, i.e. they never scan the same location more than once.

All bundles loaded by this loader will be considered as *user bundles* in the rest of the documentation.

=== 8.2. Bundle loaders execution order

At startup, Dandelion loads all bundles in a particular order:

. First, by scanning for bundles using the `VendorBundleLoader`

. Then, by scanning for bundles using all other loaders present in the classpath, i.e. classes that extends `AbstractBundleLoader`. All bundles loaded by these loaders will be considered as *component bundles* in the rest of the documentation.

+
For example, Dandelion-Datatables provides its own bundle loader, intended to load all bundles present in the `dandelion/datatables/` folder.

. Finally by scanning for bundles using the `DandelionBundleLoader`

+
The *user bundles* are always loaded in last, for the purpose of allowing to override existing assets, e.g. coming from a *vendor bundle*.

NOTE: In a near or more distant future, Dandelion will provide a collection of components, which Dandelion-Datatables is already a part of. As Dandelion-Datatables, each component will provide its own collection of bundles (*vendor* and *component*).

=== 8.3. Plugging-in your own component bundle loaders

You may wish to write an extension that uses its own bundle loader, e.g. if you wish to scan for bundles somewhere else than in the classpath. Let's see here how to do it.

Dandelion intensively uses the http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/sound/SPI-intro.html[Service Provider Interface] mechanism introduced in Java 6.

So, in order to plug-in your own bundle loader, just follow these steps:

. Create a class that extends `AbstractBundleLoader` (you can directly implement the `BundleLoader` interface but you better use the abstract class)

+
[source, java]
----
package com.foo.bundle.loader.impl;

public class MyBundleLoader extends AbstractBundleLoader {

  private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyBundleLoader.class);
  
  @Override 
  protected Logger getLogger() {
    return LOG;
  }

  @Override
  public String getName() {
    return "my-bundle"; // <1>
  }

  @Override
  public String getPath() {
    return "any path";
  }

  @Override
  protected void doCustomBundlePostProcessing(List<BundleStorageUnit> bundles) {
    // Perform here any post processing on bundles	
  }
}
----
<1> The loader name is used for logging concerns only

. In the `META-INF/services` folder, create a text file (UTF-8 encoded) using the following convention:

+
.Example with a Maven project
[source, xml]
----
project-root
|__ src
   |__ main
      |__ resources
         |__ META-INF
            |__ services
               |__ com.github.dandelion.core.bundle.loader.BundleLoader
----

+
Inside this file, just add the fully qualified name of your own implementation. For example:

 com.foo.bundle.loader.impl.MyBundleLoader

And that's all! Thanks to the SPI mechanism, Dandelion will automatically pick up your implementation and add it to the active bundle loaders on the next server restart.
